            <dd>- This sign is the chameleon of the zodiac. Geminis can
                 adapt to almost any situation. "Whether you're meeting up with a group 
                 of friends to celebrate a birthday or making a quick cameo at a work 
                 colleague's soirée, the likelihood of a Gemini organizing either of 
                 these social events (if not both) is more than likely. "Geminis are 
                 versatile, great at adaptability, and analyzing a situation from every
                  perspective." It's what allows them to get along with pretty much anyone... well, 
                  as long as that person doesn't bore them.Geminis are communicators, problem solvers, 
                  and curious people. Because they're constantly absorbing information, both good and bad, 
                  they're some of the least judgmental people around.

        <dd>- Charm and magnetism, that's how you'll spot a Libra. This sign is
             a social butterfly like the Gemini, but pickier when it comes to 
             acquaintances. They appreciate anything beautiful—art, 
             design, and all the gratification life has to offer "as they're the only
              air sign ruled by the goddess of pleasure, Venus.
            And similar to Gemini’s environmental social game, Libras bring their contagious
             energy to their relationships and partnerships. “Libra’s are highly compromising
              and giving when it comes to love, and can bring beauty to any space they occupy.” 
              In other words, they love hard.However, as moved as they are by injustice, 
              Libras really dislike confrontation. They're likely to hide from it in 
              order to avoid getting involved. And if they do find themselves involved
               in a sticky sitch? Don't ask them to make a decision because they'll hate
                that, too.Libras are happiest when they're surrounded by the finer things in 
                life. It's all about good food, good music, and optimism for
                 this air sign.

        <dd>- "Aquarians are the trendsetters of the zodiac."
             Because they're so forward-thinking, they have a sense of what's 
             going to be relevant and what's going to flop. This mindset allows
              them to be visionaries and revolutionaries. "They genuinely
               see the possibilities that exist all around and therefore, welcome the 
               diversity in every individual point of view, even if others 
               don't. A little skepticism won't phase the Aquarius, though. They're used
                to going against the grain and waiting for everyone else to catch up.
                "Aquarius is the rebe". There's an out-of-the-box air
                 and originality to everything they do. They're unique, eccentric,
                  innovative, and bursting with bright ideas.</dd>
